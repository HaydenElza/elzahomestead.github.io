We started digging the trench for the two fish runs that will be installed. It is being dug as one big trench and then it will be partitioned inorder to have two seperate runs once completed. They will both measure 4' wide x 5' deep x 30' long and will hold about 4,500 gallons of water each for a total of 9,000 gallons!

My brother Hayden is standing in the hole to show scale.
