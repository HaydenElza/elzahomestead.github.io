The PVC hoops are up! The arches consist of 4- 10' lengths of 1.5" PVC electrical conduit glued together. Each arched is secured by driving 2' lengths of 2" PVC in to the ground inside of the base boards. Once the arches were up we drilled a hole through the base board and both pipes and fastened them securely using carraige bolts.

Plywood sides walls in place, just need the temps to cooperate so the paint can be laid down.

A good portion of the painting is done! Just the face of the hoops left to paint, this is done to protect the plastic greenhouse film from degradation due to off gassing from the PVC.
