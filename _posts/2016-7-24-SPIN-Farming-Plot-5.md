The main production area of the SPIN plot is now completed and the planting schedule is underway. On the far right is Arugula, working to the left we have Spinach, the next row is Daikon Radishes and Salad Mix. Soon I will be transplanting Large Leaf Basil, Chinese Cabbage, Bok Choy, and various green and red Leaf lettuces for Salad Mixes.

We also have some nice Sugar Pumpkins coming in. They mature as small sweet pumpkins that are perfect for baking pies and desserts.
