UPDATE 4/24/16
<br>
We painted the inside of the end walls with white paint to reflect the light and prevent any moisture issues due to temperature differences inside and out.

The aquaponics system may not be running and fear of frost is keeping us from planting outside but we can still get growing. I mixed up some soil it's just a basic high nutrient value soil mix cut in half with coco coir to reduce nutrient value for lighter feeding crops. We have broccoli, head lettuce, salad greens, and carrots.

Finally got around to starting our rain water catchment system. It is only collecting from the north half of our house's roof until I can find some more rain gutter. The plan is to collect rain from both sides of the house roof and the greenhouse. So far the system is composed of a 275 gal food grade bulk tank and some pvc pipe to route water to the tank.

It's hard to believe it has been over a month since the last update! Between the holiday season and all the progress made time has gone fast.

The two layers of plastic are now inflated using a small squirrel cage blower.

I set up the blower to pull air from outside via a HEPA filter. 
The filter will keep unwanted pests, moisture, and debris from finding their way inbetween the plastic. 
Pulling air from outside will ensure the greenhouse is not under negative pressure allowing in drafts of outside air. 
This is most important during the winter months.

Here is a picture of the inflated plastic from the inside. 
Note the rippled archs pushing inward between the pvc pipes.

The double barrel wood stove was built from two 50gal drums and stove kit. 
It turned out really nice and wastes little heat.

When the bottom barrel is at 400f the chimney pipe is at 100f.

Air to the stove is feed by a pipe threaded into the bottom. 
The pipe is connected to a larger pvc pipe with a boxed in axial fan in one section. 
The fan draws air from outside so that the stove will not create a draft from any leaks in the greenhouse.

I had to make a "broom" to sweep snow off the greenhouse film. It started as a foam snow brush for cars.
