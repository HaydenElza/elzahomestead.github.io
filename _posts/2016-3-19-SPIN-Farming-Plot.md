SPIN Farming = Small Plot INtensive
<br>
Just a sneek peak of our 2,600+sqft outdoor SPIN farming plot.

UPDATE 3/29/16 
<br>
We used reinforced poly film to cover the greenhouse/processing area. The film is not intended for greenhouse use but will serve the purpose. The reinforcment netting inside the poly actually diffuses the light while allowing ~80-90% light transmission, perfect for seed starting and young plants. Next we will build out the processing tables and equipment inside.

UPDATE 3/28/16
<br>
This will serve as a seed starting greenhouse and our processing area for this site. All that needs to be done is add the poly film and the structure will be ready.
