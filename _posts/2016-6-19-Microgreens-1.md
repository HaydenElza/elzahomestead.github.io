Here is our microgreens operation. We have Daikon Radish and Speckled Pea pictured below. More varieties to come soon! They are grown from organic seed in high quality organic soil. 
<br>
They go great with burgers and sandwiches, especially tuna and chicken salad. They are also excellent with soup and of course on top of a salad. I will post a list of 52 microgreen recipe ideas below the pics for anyone interested. :)
