After a few back breaking months the 30'x8'x4.5' hole is finally dug. This was dug using a single wheel barrow and 90%+ of the 
labor input was from only two people. Incase your wondering no we could not have dug the hole with heavy equipment before 
building the greenhouse lol... It would have been inpractical to build such an elaborate structure, with no heavy equipment, 
around a giant hole. Now to install a liner and build the beds for the aquaponics system... the fun never ends. :)
