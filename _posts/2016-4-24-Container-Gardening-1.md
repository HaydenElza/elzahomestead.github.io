The aquaponics system may not be finished and fear of frost is keeping us from planting outside but we can still get growing. I mixed up a nice organic soil mix it's just a basic high nutrient value soil mix cut in half with coco coir to reduce nutrient value for lighter feeding crops. We have broccoli, head lettuce, salad greens, and carrots to start. These plants are being grown using TLO = True Living Organics, this refers to promoting/utilizing the colonization of beneficial microbes in an organic soil mix to allow plants to acheive their maximum potential. Plants grown in this manor are healthier and therefore more pest resistant, grow more vigorously, and produce an all around better end product. :)
