After a few back breaking months the 30'x8'x4.5' hole is finally dug. This was dug using a single wheel barrow and 90%+ of the labor input was from only two people. Incase your wondering no we could not have dug the hole with heavy equipment before building the greenhouse lol. It would have been inpractical to build such an elaborate structure, also with no heavy equipment, around a giant hole. Now to install a liner and build the beds for the aquaponics system... the fun never ends :)

We started digging the trench for the two fish runs that will be installed. It is being dug as one large fish run and then it will be partitioned as needed. It will measure 8' wide x 4.5' deep x 30' long and will hold about 8,000 gallons!

My brother Hayden is standing in the hole to show scale.
