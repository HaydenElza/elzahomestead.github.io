Today we worked on painting. We finished one coat on the ends and the bottom portion of the hoops. Painting the plywood protects it from the elements while painting the hoops protects against the covering plastic from becoming brittle due to direct contact with the PVC hoops.

We also started digging the trenches for the fish reservoirs. The goals is to dig them five feet deep which is going to take some time.
