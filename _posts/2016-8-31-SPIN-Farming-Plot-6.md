Alot has happened since the last update roughly a month ago. Pics are in order from oldest working down to newest. We have various stages of salad mixes, Red Oak Leaf and Green Oak Leaf salad bowl lettuces, Tatsoi, Spinach, Daikon and Pink Beauty Radishes.

These last few shots were taken today. The arugula and Spinach have both been cropped out and replaced. The netting you see is Agribon 15, it offers minor shade, pest control, moisture control, and frost prevention when the time comes.
