We painted the inside of the end walls with white paint to reflect the light and prevent any moisture issues due to temperature differences inside and out.

Finally got around to starting our rain water catchment system. It is only collecting from the north half of our house's roof until I can find some more rain gutter. The plan is to collect rain from both sides of the house roof and the greenhouse. So far the system is composed of a 275 gal food grade bulk tank and some pvc pipe to route water to the tank.
