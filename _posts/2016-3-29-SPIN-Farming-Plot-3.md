We used reinforced poly film to cover the greenhouse/processing area. The film is not intended for greenhouse use but will serve the purpose. The reinforcment netting inside the poly actually diffuses the light while allowing ~80-90% light transmission, perfect for seed starting and young plants. Next we will build out the processing tables and equipment inside. :)
